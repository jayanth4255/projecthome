    <p>Apple Watch is a wearable smartwatch that allows users to accomplish a variety of tasks, including making phone
        calls, sending text messages and reading email. Apple released the first Apple Watch on April 24, 2015.

        Apple initially designed the watch to replace phones and reduce the time users spend looking at phone screens.
        However, the Apple Watch became popular in part for its innovations in fitness tracking and health monitoring,
        as well as its ability to be used with internet of things (IoT) devices.

        Since its release, the Apple Watch has added several new features, including water resistance, blood oxygen and
        electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, a body temperature sensor and an emergency SOS that can detect when a user
        falls or has some other accident and contact emergency services. The watches can be synced with a user's iPhone,
        Mac laptop and AirPods. Apple Watches accounted for 22% of smartwatch shipments in the second quarter of 2023,
        dominating that market, according to research firm Counterpoint.</p>

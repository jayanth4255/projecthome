            <p>Electrons & conductors
                Electronics basic components are electrons and conductors. Electrons are subatomic negatively charged
                particles, while conductors consist of materials that allow the electrons to flow freely.

                Electrons create an electrical current when they flow through a conductor. The current can be used to
                power electronic devices.

                Circuits
                The circuit is the heart of an electronic device. Circuits consist of resistors, capacitors,
                transistors, and conductors.

                Resistors limit the flow of electrons, unlike conductors which allow them to flow freely. Transistors
                control the flow of electrons while capacitors store electrical energy.
                Computers
                Today, the computer is the most common type of electronic device. It uses a CPU or central processing
                unit to process information. The CPU is the computer’s ‘brain’ – it uses a combination of electronic
                circuits to perform a wide range of tasks.

                Other devices
                Radios, digital cameras, televisions (TVs), and smartphones are other examples of electronic devices.
                TVs use either a liquid crystal display (LCD) or cathode-ray tube (CRT) to display moving images.

                Radios use a combination of electronics to tune into different frequencies to broadcast plays, shows,
                news programs, music, etc,.

                Smartphones, which serve as mini-computers, cameras, telephones, pocket watches, and personal organizers
                use electronics to take and store pictures plus dozens of other functions.

                Consumer electronics
                Electronic equipment that has been created for everyday use, i.e., for use at home, is called consumer
                electronics. We also refer to these products as home electronics.
                Laptops/Computers, digital cameras, smartphones, TVs, video game consoles, Bluetooth speakers, and
                tablets are examples of consumer electronic devices.

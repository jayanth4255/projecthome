    <h5>A machine that gives you full access to a computer in a small package is called a laptop. You can easily take it
        with you everywhere. It takes up little space and can be used for hours without access to electricity. Are you
        looking for a good, low-cost, low-weight, and small-size system for reading and writing information? So it would
        be best if you had a laptop with a good display, a strong battery, and a GPUS card with large storage with audio
        output. To start serious gaming, you can upgrade and modify many gaming systems with everything in mind.

        Laptops come in various sizes, usually referring to the display size. Mainstream laptops range in size from 10
        inches to 20 inches. They weigh up to a few pounds.

        Laptops come in different resolutions. 1280x800 to 1920x1080Û”

        Laptop hard drives are smaller than desktop hard drives and depend on energy savings and performance, such as
        4500, 5400 to 7200 RPM (rotation per minute).

        Laptop batteries are one hour to ten hours.

        Battery life depends on the battery's capacity, which is noted in watts per hour, and the laptop's power
        consumption. Laptop battery life varies from less than an hour for a gaming laptop to more than 10 hours for a
        smaller laptop.</h5>
        
    <h2>Mobiles</h2><a href="mobiles.html"><img src="cell.jpg" height="150" width="125"></a>
    <h5>A smartphone is a cellular telephone with an integrated computer and other features not originally associated with telephones, such as an operating system (OS), web browsing and the ability to run software applications.
        Email and messaging. Email and messaging applications can be loaded on a smartphone, letting users receive and send messages from their phone.
Social media. Many consumers use smartphones to engage with friends, family and brands on social media. Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn, have mobile apps that users download from a phone's app store. Smartphone apps make it possible for users to post personal updates and photos while on the go.
Health and wellness. Another common use for smartphones is health and wellness tracking. For instance, the Health app for Apple iOS tracks sleep behavior, nutrition, body measurements, vital signs and mental health exercises.
Connecting with other devices. Third-party wearable devices, such as smartwatches, can connect with a smartphone to monitor an individual's health statistics, such as heart rate and number of steps walked, and send that information to be aggregated on the phone.
Mobile payment. Digital wallet features let users save credit card information on their phones to make mobile payments when buying items. Apps such as Apple Pay also enable users to pay other iOS users directly from their phones.</h5>

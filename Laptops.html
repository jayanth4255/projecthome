    <h3>HP:</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="hp.jpg" width="250">
    <p>Hewlett-Packard Company, American manufacturer of software and computer services and a major brand in the history
        of computers and computer-related products. The company split in 2015 into two companies: HP Inc. and Hewlett
        Packard Enterprise. Headquarters were in Palo Alto, California.

        Founding and early growth
        The company was founded on January 1, 1939, by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, two recent
        electrical-engineering graduates of Stanford University. It was the first of many technology companies to
        benefit from the ideas and support of engineering professor Frederick Terman, who pioneered the strong
        relationship between Stanford and what eventually emerged as Silicon Valley. The company established its
        reputation as a maker of sophisticated instrumentation. Its first customer was Walt Disney Productions, which
        purchased eight audio oscillators to use in the making of its full-length animated film Fantasia (1940). During
        World War II the company developed products for military applications that were important enough to merit
        Packard a draft exemption, while Hewlett served in the Army Signal Corps. Throughout the war the company worked
        with the Naval Research Laboratory to build counter-radar technology and advanced artillery shell fuses.</p>
